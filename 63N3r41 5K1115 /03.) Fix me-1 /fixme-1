Indentation means adding spaces at the beginning of a line to show which lines of code belong together. 
In Python, indentation is important because it helps the program know which code belongs inside loops, 
functions, or conditionals.
# Correct indentation
if True:
    print("This is inside the if block")  # This line is indented
print("This is outside the if block")  # No indentation here
