Bob is a student of your class. He sends a message using Standard AES using a code he has written but he feels 
that it isn't enough. So he modifies the code and encrypts the cipher he gets from the standard AES using the 
modified AES and sends the final ciphertext along with the code he used. Can you identify the message?

The passphrase used is "EncryptedLessons14821"
